# this configuration file is used to configure the actual simulation of the source.
# this simulation can be done only once the background(s) have(has) been simulated and
# the models already created.
# It will crash if the folders that are given as inputs for the data are found to be empty

# If the mode is manual, the times of the simulations are those specified and the IRF is the one chosen.
# If the mode is AUTO, the visibility of the source is taken into account. This affects:
# - times can either be from the onset of the GRB or from the time at which the source is visible
